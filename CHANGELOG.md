# dbt_pinterest v1.0.0

[PR #43](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/pull/43) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Changes

### Source Package Consolidation
- Removed the dependency on the `fivetran/pinterest_source` package.
  - All functionality from the source package has been merged into this transformation package for improved maintainability and clarity.
  - If you reference `fivetran/pinterest_source` in your `packages.yml`, you must remove this dependency to avoid conflicts.
  - Any source overrides referencing the `fivetran/pinterest_source` package will also need to be removed or updated to reference this package.
  - Update any pinterest_source-scoped variables to be scoped to only under this package. See the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/blob/main/README.md) for how to configure the build schema of staging models.
- As part of the consolidation, vars are no longer used to reference staging models, and only sources are represented by vars. Staging models are now referenced directly with `ref()` in downstream models.

### dbt Fusion Compatibility Updates
- Updated package to maintain compatibility with dbt-core versions both before and after v1.10.6, which introduced a breaking change to multi-argument test syntax (e.g., `unique_combination_of_columns`).
- Temporarily removed unsupported tests to avoid errors and ensure smoother upgrades across different dbt-core versions. These tests will be reintroduced once a safe migration path is available.
  - Removed all `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` tests.
  - Removed all `accepted_values` tests.
  - Moved `loaded_at_field: _fivetran_synced` under the `config:` block in `src_pinterest.yml`.

### Under the Hood
- Updated conditions in `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`.
- Added `.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml`.

# dbt_pinterest v0.13.0

[PR #40](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/pull/40) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Change for dbt Core < 1.9.6
> *Note: This is not relevant to Fivetran Quickstart users.*

Migrated `freshness` from a top-level source property to a source `config` in alignment with [recent updates](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/11506) from dbt Core ([Source PR #40](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest_source/pull/40)). This will resolve the following deprecation warning that users running dbt >= 1.9.6 may have received:

```
[WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
Found `freshness` as a top-level property of `pinterest_ads` in file
`models/src_pinterest_ads.yml`. The `freshness` top-level property should be moved
into the `config` of `pinterest_ads`.
```

**IMPORTANT:** Users running dbt Core < 1.9.6 will not be able to utilize freshness tests in this release or any subsequent releases, as older versions of dbt will not recognize freshness as a source `config` and therefore not run the tests.

If you are using dbt Core < 1.9.6 and want to continue running Pinterest Ads freshness tests, please elect **one** of the following options:
  1. (Recommended) Upgrade to dbt Core >= 1.9.6
  2. Do not upgrade your installed version of the `pinterest` package. Pin your dependency on v0.12.0 in your `packages.yml` file.
  3. Utilize a dbt [override](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/overrides) to overwrite the package's `pinterest_ads` source and apply freshness via the [old](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest_source/blob/v0.12.0/models/src_pinterest_ads.yml#L11-L13) top-level property route. This will require you to copy and paste the entirety of the `src_pinterest_ads.yml` [file](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest_source/blob/v0.12.0/models/src_pinterest_ads.yml#L4-L399) and add an `overrides: pinterest_source` property.

## Under the Hood
- Updated the package maintainer PR template.

## Features
- Added the following vars to enable/disable the new sources. See the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest_ads_source/blob/main/README.md#Step-4-Enable-disable-models-and-sources) for more details.
  - `pinterest__using_pin_promotion_targeting_report`
    - Default is true. Will disable `pinterest_ads__campaign_country_report` and `pinterest_ads__campaign_region_report` if false.
  - `pinterest__using_targeting_geo`
    - Default is true. Will disable `pinterest_ads__campaign_country_report` if false.
  - `pinterest__using_targeting_geo_region`
    - Default is true. Will disable `pinterest_ads__campaign_region_report` if false.
- Added the var `pinterest__pin_promotion_targeting_report_passthrough_metrics` to allow bringing additional metrics through to the `pinterest_ads__campaign_country_report` and `pinterest_ads__campaign_region_report` models. Refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest_ads/blob/main/README.md#passing-through-additional-metrics) for more details.

## Under the Hood
- Added seed data for testing new sources
- Updated the `consistency_url_report` test to be at the `advertiser_id` grain instead of `keyword_id`.

## Documentation
- Updated dbt documentation to reflect new tables and column additions.
- Added Quickstart model counts to README. ([#38](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/pull/38))
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#38](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/pull/38))

# dbt_pinterest v0.11.0
[PR #34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/pull/34) includes the following **BREAKING CHANGE** updates:

## Feature Updates: Native Conversion Support
- We have added the following conversion metrics to each `pinterest_ads` end model:
  - `total_conversions`: The sum of all website conversion events.
  - `total_conversions_quantity`: The total count of items or units involved in conversions.
  - `total_conversions_value` (converted from `total_conversions_value_in_micro_dollar`) Total order value associated with conversions.
- In the event that you were already passing the above fields in via our [passthrough columns](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/blob/main/README.md#passing-through-additional-metrics), the package will dynamically avoid "duplicate column" errors.

> The above new field additions are **breaking changes** for users who were not already bringing in conversion fields via passthrough columns.

## Documentation
- Added more information about the difference in grains and their relationships in the [DECISIONLOG](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/blob/main/DECISIONLOG.md#pinterest-ads-grains).

## Under the hood
- Created `pinterest_ads_persist_pass_through_columns` macro to ensure that the new conversion fields are backwards compatible with users who have already included them via passthrough fields.
- Added integrity and consistency validation tests within `integration_tests` folder for the transformation models (to be used by maintainers only).
- Updated seed data to represent an e-commerce customer scenario.
- Coalesces `spend` with 0 to ensure proper downstream aggregations.

| current  | previous |
|----------|----------|
| pinterest_ads_ad_group_history_identifier | pinterest_ad_group_history_identifier |
| pinterest_ads_campaign_history_identifier | pinterest_campaign_history_identifier |
| pinterest_ads_pin_promotion_report_identifier | pinterest_pin_promotion_report_identifier |

## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple pinterest connectors. Refer to the [Union Multiple Connectors README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.

## Under the hood ðŸš˜
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. 
- To distinguish which source each field comes from, added `source_relation` column in each staging and downstream model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro.
  - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins in the transform package. 
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column.

# dbt_pinterest v0.9.0

# Pinterest Ads v5 Upgrade
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨:
[PR #26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest/pull/26) introduces the following changes:

- Following Pinterest Ads deprecating the v4 API on June 30, 2023 in place of v5, the Pinterest Ads Fivetran connector now leverages the Pinterest v5 API. The following fields have been deprecated/introduced:

| **Model** | **Removed**  | **New**   |
|---|---|---|
|  [pinterest_ads__advertiser_report](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_pinterest/#!/model/model.pinterest.pinterest_ads__advertiser_report) | `billing_type`, `status`  |   |

## Under the Hood:
- Following the v5 upgrade, `ad_account_id` is a net new field within `ad_group_history` and `pin_promotion_history` source tables synced via the connector. However, to keep these fields standard across the package, we have renamed them as `advertiser_id` within the respective staging models.
- Seed data were updated with new/removed fields following the v5 upgrade
